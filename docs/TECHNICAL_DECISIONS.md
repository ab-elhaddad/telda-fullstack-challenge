# Technical Decisions

This document outlines the key technical decisions made during the development of the Movie Application, explaining the reasoning behind our technology choices and architectural patterns.

## Architecture Overview

The Movie Application follows a modern client-server architecture with a clear separation between:

1. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application (SPA)
2. **Backend**: Node.js REST API server
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL relational database

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### Separation of Concerns

We've structured both frontend and backend with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Components, state management, services, and utilities are all separately defined
- **Backend**: Controllers, services, data access, middleware, and utilities are distinct

This approach improves maintainability, testability, and allows for easier onboarding of new developers.

## Frontend Technical Decisions

### React with TypeScript

**Decision**: Use React with TypeScript for the frontend application.

**Rationale**:

- Type safety provides improved code quality and developer experience
- Prevents many common runtime errors during development
- Enables better IDE support with autocompletion and inline documentation
- Improves refactoring capabilities and maintainability

### Vite as Build Tool

**Decision**: Use Vite instead of Create React App (CRA) or Webpack directly.

**Rationale**:

- Significantly faster development server startup and hot module replacement
- Built-in optimizations for production builds
- Native ESM support for better performance
- Simpler configuration with robust defaults

### React Query for API Communication

**Decision**: Use React Query for API state management instead of Redux or custom hooks.

**Rationale**:

- Built-in caching and request deduplication
- Automatic refetching and background updates
- Loading and error states built into the hook return values
- Optimistic updates and mutations with rollback capabilities
- Server state is kept separate from client state

### Zustand for State Management

**Decision**: Use Zustand instead of Redux or Context API for global state.

**Rationale**:

- Simpler API with less boilerplate than Redux
- Better performance than Context API for frequent updates
- TypeScript support with minimal configuration
- Supports middleware pattern for extensibility
- Small bundle size

### React Hook Form and Zod

**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation.

**Rationale**:

- Uncontrolled component approach for better performance
- Built-in validation and error handling
- TypeScript integration with Zod ensures type-safe form data
- Reduced re-renders compared to controlled components
- Zod provides robust, composable validation schemas

### Component Structure

**Decision**: Organize components by feature and split large components into smaller ones.

**Rationale**:

- Improves code maintainability by keeping related code together
- Makes components easier to test in isolation
- Facilitates code reuse across the application
- Simplifies code reviews and developer onboarding
- Enables parallel development on different features

Example from the Profile page refactoring:

- Split monolithic ProfilePage into ProfilePage, PersonalInfoCard, SecurityCard, DangerZoneCard, ChangePasswordModal, and ProfileSkeleton

## Backend Technical Decisions

### Node.js with Express

**Decision**: Use Node.js with Express for the backend API.

**Rationale**:

- JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack reduces context switching
- Express offers a minimal, flexible framework with robust middleware ecosystem
- Extensive community support and libraries
- Good performance for API workloads

### TypeScript on Backend

**Decision**: Use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript.

**Rationale**:

- Consistent language between frontend and backend
- Type safety for API contracts and database models
- Better maintainability and refactoring support
- Improved documentation through types

### PostgreSQL Database

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL instead of NoSQL or other SQL databases.

**Rationale**:

- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Advanced querying capabilities
- JSON support for flexible schema where needed
- Strong ecosystem and tooling
- Excellent performance for relational data

### JWT Authentication with HttpOnly Cookies

**Decision**: Use JWTs stored in HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage or sessionStorage.

**Rationale**:

- Better security against XSS attacks (JavaScript cannot access HttpOnly cookies)
- Automatic inclusion in requests to the same domain
- Stateless authentication maintains scalability
- Token refresh strategy mitigates risk of long-lived tokens
- Support for both access and refresh tokens

## Testing Strategy

### Jest for Both Frontend and Backend

**Decision**: Use Jest as the testing framework for both frontend and backend.

**Rationale**:

- Consistent testing approach across the stack
- Built-in mocking capabilities
- Snapshot testing for UI components
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Good TypeScript support

### React Testing Library (Didn't have time to implement)

**Decision**: Use React Testing Library for frontend component tests.

**Rationale**:

- Encourages testing from the user's perspective
- Tests behavior rather than implementation details
- Reduces test brittleness during refactoring
- Improves accessibility by encouraging proper HTML semantics

### Supertest for API Testing (Didn't have time to implement)

**Decision**: Use Supertest for backend API integration tests.

**Rationale**:

- Enables realistic API testing with HTTP requests
- Can be combined with Jest for a seamless testing experience
- Tests the complete request-response cycle
- Helps identify issues in middleware, controllers, and error handling

## Frontend-Backend Communication

### Standard API Response Structure

**Decision**: Use a standard response envelope for all API responses: `{ status: boolean, message: string, data: T }`

**Rationale**:

- Consistent error and success handling
- Clear separation between application status, user messages, and actual data
- Simplifies frontend logic for handling responses
- Enables consistent toast notifications and error displays

### REST API Design

**Decision**: Follow REST principles for API design.

**Rationale**:

- Widely understood pattern
- Leverages standard HTTP methods and status codes
- Clear resource-oriented structure
- Stateless communication for better scalability

## Future Considerations

### Potential Technology Migrations

1. **GraphQL**: Consider migrating from REST to GraphQL if:

   - The frontend needs more flexible data fetching
   - Over-fetching becomes a performance issue
   - The API surface grows significantly

2. **Server Components**: Evaluate React Server Components when they mature to improve:

   - Initial page load performance
   - SEO capabilities
   - Reduce client-side JavaScript

3. **Edge Functions**: Consider moving certain API functionalities to edge functions for:
   - Lower latency for global users
   - Reduced server costs for simple operations

### Performance Optimization Path

1. **Current approach**: Client-side rendering with optimistic UI updates
2. **Near-term improvements**:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Optimize image loading with responsive images
3. **Long-term strategy**:
   - Evaluate static site generation for content pages
   - Consider server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages
   - Investigate partial hydration techniques
